# Fashion class Classification
 Machine Learning:Fashion class classification Convolutional neural network/deep learning

 This repository trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts.

 This repository uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

 This guide uses the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:
